### :wrench: A Driven Collaborator and Leader

I am passionate about working with people and building new things. Currently, I've been working as an API developer at an innovative dating app called TrueView where I help the team focus on our goals, track our progress and communicate with one another.

Collaborative, project-based environments are my forte. To complement my skills, I studies project management, earning a PMI registered certificate in 2014. I'm a huge fan of Agile methodologies!
