## :earth_americas: <a name="overview"> Overview</a>

I’ve had a diverse professional journey so far, having worked and studied in North America, Africa and Europe.  Yet, it was the past 16 weeks as a student at [*Makers Academy*](#education) (a London-based coding bootcamp), which led to one of my most rapid self-development transformations. I feel equipped with the skills to be a junior developer, but this is also marks the beginning of a journey in a new direction.

I’ve become a developer because I see this as a place where I can be learning all the time and where continuous growth is welcomed.

## :zap:<a name="strengths"> Strengths</a>

### :mag_right: Professional 'Learn-aholic'

The most valuable thing that I could bring to your team as a junior developer is my continual quest for knowledge and self-improvement. Most recently, I completed a [*master's degree*](#education) where I did primary research on the environmental impacts of the textile industry in Bangladesh. I also won the award for best academic paper / presentation at a conference for my master's research.

What does all this have to do with coding? Everything. When I started learning javascript, it was intimidating. But it was the challenge of  learning a completely new language that really drove me to work hard. I spent days researching syntax and structure and in the end managed to produce [*code that I am proud of* ](https://github.com/timchipperfield/chasing_shadows).

### :wrench: A Driven Collaborator

As a [*political consultant*](#work), I worked on fast-paced team-based projects which helped me learn that a great team is greater than the sum of its individual members.

I usually found myself taking on two roles in a team. Firstly, as the one who keeps the team focused on the and goal and lays out solutions to reach project goals on time. The second role is that of the workhorse - once the team decides what needs to be done, I can happily take a chunk of a project and run with it.

I love team and project-based environments and to complement my skills, I [*studied project management*](#education), earning a certificate in 2014.

### :bulb: Creative Problem Solver

My transition to coding might appear sudden but it’s been a long time coming. It may have started on the other side of the world, while working on a [*mangrove reforestation project in Mozambique*](#work), where I found that people started seeing me as a problem solver for their computer issues. I also realised that I enjoyed making simple websites yet that I yearned for more. Or it may have started from the age of 11 when I won a giant castle for coming first in a lego making competition. Even back then, I recognised that I could use same building blocks in a different way to make an amazing product.

This is why I chose a career in development. It's a chance to use my brain to build something creative and unique that I can be proud of.
