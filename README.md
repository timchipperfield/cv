## :earth_americas: <a name="overview"> Overview</a>

I'm a people-focused problem solver and I'm passionate about delivering high-quality technology solutions to make life better for people.  My professional journey has taken me around the world to deliver these solutions, and most recently, I decided to upgrade my technical skills by taking the Makers Academy course. 

## :zap:<a name="strengths"> Strengths</a>

### :wrench: A Driven Collaborator

As a [*political consultant*](#work), I worked on fast-paced team-based projects which helped me learn that a great team is greater than the sum of its individual members.

I usually found myself taking on two roles in a team. Firstly, as the one who keeps the team focused on the end goal and lays out solutions to reach project goals on time. The second role is that of the workhorse - once the team decides what needs to be done, I can happily take a chunk of a project and run with it.

I love team and project-based environments and to complement my skills, I [*studied project management*](#education), earning a PMI registered certificate in 2014.

### :bulb: Creative Problem Solver

My transition to coding might appear sudden but itâ€™s been a long time coming. It may have started on the other side of the world, while working on a [*mangrove reforestation project in Mozambique*](#work), where I found that people started seeing me as a problem solver for their computer issues. I also realised that I enjoyed making simple websites yet that I yearned for more. Or it may have started from the age of 11 when I won a giant castle for coming first in a lego making competition. Even back then, I recognised that I could use same building blocks in a different way to make an amazing product.

This is why I chose a career in development. It's a chance to use my brain to build something creative and unique that I can be proud of. I try to callenge myself each day; for example, by working on CodeWars kata problems:
