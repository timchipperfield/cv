# Tim Chipperfield


## Overview
***
I’ve had an diverse professional journey so far, having worked and studied in North America, Africa and Europe.  Yet, it was the past 16 weeks as a student at Makers Academy (a London Based coding bootcamp), which led to one of my most rapid self-development transformations.  I’m confident that I am now ready to be a junior developer but I would also say that my journey is just beginning.

I’ve become a developer because I see this as a place where I can be learning all the time, where continuous growth is welcomed and where I can reach my potential.

## A Few of My Strengths
***

### Professional 'Learn-aholic'

The biggest thing that I could bring to your team as a junior developer: my continual quest for knowledge and self-improvement. Most recently, I conducted studies for my Masters Degree on the environmental impacts from the textile in Bangaldesh. I also won the award for best academic paper / presentation at a conference in May.

What does all this have to do with coding? Everything. When I started learning javascript, it was intimidating. But it was the challenge of  learning a completely new language that really drove me to work hard. I spent days researching and in the end managed to produce code that I am proud of.

### Driven Project Collaborator

I’ve worked in a team-based environment in most of my adult life. As a political consultant, I worked on highly diverse and fast paced teams. I usually find myself taking on two roles in a team. The first is the one who keeps the team focused on the and goal… to complement and expand upon my project skills, I studied project management in and earned a certificate in 2014.

### Lover of Technology and Creative Approaches

My transition to coding has been a might appear sudden but it’s a been a long time coming. It may have started on the other side of the world, while working in overseas development in Mozambique, where I found that people started seeing me as a problem solver for their computer issues. I also realized that I enjoyed making simple websites yet that I yearned for more.
